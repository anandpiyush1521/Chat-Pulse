Determining the Polarity and Statistics of Chat Based on Sentiment Analysis
Introduction
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of chat conversations and determine their polarity using sentiment analysis techniques. By applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, we can gain insights into the emotional tone and sentiment of chat interactions.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: The core functionality of this project is to determine the sentiment or emotional polarity of chat conversations. It leverages machine learning models trained on labeled data to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

Polarity Detection: In addition to sentiment analysis, the project provides the ability to detect the polarity of chat conversations. It assigns a score to each conversation, indicating whether it is predominantly positive, negative, or neutral.

Statistics and Metrics: The project also generates statistics and metrics based on the sentiment analysis results. This includes the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in the chat data, as well as any other relevant metrics for analyzing the sentiment trends.

Customization: The sentiment analysis model used in this project can be customized and fine-tuned based on specific requirements. Users have the flexibility to adjust the model parameters, feature selection, or use their own trained models for sentiment analysis.

Requirements
To run this project, the following dependencies are required:

<li>Python 3.7 or above</li>
<li>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library</li>
<li>Scikit-learn library</li>
<li>Pandas library</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook or any other Python development environment</li>

<h4>Installation and Setup</h4>
Clone the project repository from GitHub:

<li>git clone https://github.com/anandpiyush1521/Chat-Pulse.git </li>

Install the required Python libraries using pip:
<li>pip install -r requirements.txt</li>


<h4>Usage</h4>
<b>Prepare the Chat Data:</b> Ensure that the chat data you want to analyze is in a suitable format. It can be stored in a CSV, JSON, or text file, with each chat conversation in a separate record.

<b>Data Preprocessing:</b> If necessary, perform any required data preprocessing steps such as cleaning, tokenization, and removing stopwords to prepare the data for sentiment analysis.

<b>Run Sentiment Analysis:</b> Utilize the provided code in the notebook to perform sentiment analysis on the chat data. This will generate sentiment labels for each chat conversation.

<b>Calculate Polarity:</b> Use the polarity detection functionality to calculate the overall polarity of the chat conversations. This will provide a score or label indicating whether the chat data is mostly positive, negative, or neutral.

<b>Generate Statistics and Metrics:</b> Analyze the sentiment distribution and any other relevant metrics to gain insights into the sentiment trends in the chat data.

<b>Visualize Results:</b> Use data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visual representations of the sentiment analysis results and statistics, aiding in the interpretation of the findings.
