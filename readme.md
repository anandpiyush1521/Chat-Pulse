[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

## Overview

**Chat-Pulse** is a powerful tool for analyzing the sentiment and emotional polarity of chat conversations. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, Chat-Pulse processes textual chat data to provide insights into the emotional tone of conversations. Whether you're looking to assess customer satisfaction, monitor team dynamics, or analyze social media interactions, Chat-Pulse helps you unlock valuable insights by automatically determining whether chat conversations are positive, negative, or neutral.

## Key Features

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Core functionality**: Automatically classifies chat messages into sentiment categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.
   - **Machine Learning Models**: Built on robust models trained on large datasets, enabling highly accurate sentiment predictions.

### 2. **Polarity Detection**
   - **Polarity Score**: Detects the polarity of chat conversations and provides a score that indicates the overall emotional tone—positive, negative, or neutral.
   - **Granular Insights**: Analyzes not just individual messages but entire conversations, ensuring a complete understanding of chat sentiment trends.

### 3. **Statistics & Metrics**
   - **Sentiment Distribution**: Generate detailed statistics that show the percentage distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments across the dataset.
   - **Sentiment Trends**: Track sentiment changes over time to identify patterns, spikes, or shifts in mood.
   - **Customizable Metrics**: Tailor the sentiment analysis output to fit your specific needs (e.g., topic-based sentiment or sentiment by user).

### 4. **Visualization**
   - **Dynamic Graphs**: Use data visualization tools like **Matplotlib** to create clear, informative graphs that showcase sentiment distribution, trends, and overall sentiment intensity.
   - **Interactive Dashboards**: Customize your own dashboards for continuous monitoring and more engaging visual insights.

### 5. **Customization & Extensibility**
   - **Model Fine-tuning**: Customize the sentiment analysis model according to your domain-specific needs. Train on your own datasets, adjust parameters, and optimize for your particular use case.
   - **Flexible Input Formats**: Analyze chat data in various formats (CSV, JSON, Text), ensuring compatibility with your existing workflows.
   - **Pluggable Algorithms**: Easily swap out or combine different machine learning models to enhance sentiment detection accuracy.

### 6. **Real-time Analysis**
   - **Instant Sentiment Detection**: Analyze chat messages in real-time or batch process large datasets for historical analysis.
   - **API Integration**: Integrate with other applications or services to analyze chat data in real-time, offering immediate insights.

## Installation

To get started with Chat-Pulse, follow the installation instructions below:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Additionally, you need the following Python packages:

- **NLTK** – Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms and models
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anandpiyush1521/Chat-Pulse.git
```

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
##### Ensure your environment is set up correctly by installing the dependencies:
```bash
cd Chat-Pulse
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Setup Jupyter Notebook
##### Run Jupyter Notebook in your project directory
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Usage Guide
- Prepare Your Data: Ensure the chat data is in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or Text files).Each record should represent one chat message or one conversation. Ensure that each record contains the chat message, sender details, and timestamp if needed.
- Data Preprocessing: Before analysis, you may need to clean your chat data:
  - Remove special characters and non-alphanumeric symbols.
  - Tokenize the text into words or phrases.
  - Remove stopwords, punctuation, and common noise that does not contribute to sentiment.

- Run Sentiment Analysis
    - Use the notebook or scripts to run sentiment analysis. The system will automatically classify each chat message into Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
    - The sentiment results will be stored in a new column in your dataset for easy reference.
- Calculate Polarity
    - After sentiment classification, use the Polarity Detection feature to calculate an overall polarity score for the entire dataset.
    - The polarity score can range from -1 (Negative) to 1 (Positive), with 0 indicating a neutral tone.
- Generate Sentiment Statistics
    - Use built-in functions to generate sentiment distribution statistics, such as:
    - Percentage of Positive, Negative, and Neutral messages.
    - Trend Analysis to track sentiment over time.
- Visualization
    - Leverage Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize the sentiment distribution and trends over time with graphs like:
    - Pie charts showing sentiment percentages.
    - Line plots for sentiment trends over a specific time period.
    - Histograms for sentiment intensity distribution.
- Customization & Fine-tuning
    - Customize the underlying sentiment analysis model by training it on your own labeled dataset.
    - Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different text feature extraction techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec).

### Example Workflow
- Load Data: Import your chat dataset.
- Preprocess: Clean and tokenize the text data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Classify each chat message's sentiment.
- Polarity Detection: Get the overall polarity score.
- Generate Stats: Calculate sentiment distribution and trends.
- Visualize: Create insightful visualizations of your data and analysis.
### Real-World Applications
- Customer Support: Analyze the tone of customer service interactions to gauge customer - satisfaction.
- Social Media: Monitor public sentiment around a brand, product, or event.
- Team Communication: Assess the sentiment of internal communication within teams or organizations.
- Marketing: Evaluate sentiment around marketing campaigns, product launches, and brand messaging.
